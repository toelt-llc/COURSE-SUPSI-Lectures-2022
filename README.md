# SUPSI Lectures - Spring 2022
This repositories contains the material for 4 lectures given at the Italian university of applied science in Switzerland.

# Lecture 1 - 7th April 2022 - Introduction to Keras and Jupyter Notebooks

In this lecture we will look at a brief introduction to TensorFlow and Keras. Library used to build and train neural networks in an easy and efficient way. The lecture will be divided in a theory block and an easy hands-on part. We will touch the following topics

1. [Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb#recent=true) - An Introduction
2. Keras and TensorFlow - An Introduction [PowerPoint Download Link](https://github.com/toelt-llc/SUPSI-Lectures-2022/blob/main/1%20-%20Keras%20and%20TF/Quick%20Keras%20Overview.pptx)
3. Hands-on session - [JUPYTER NOTEBOOK](https://colab.research.google.com/github/toelt-llc/SUPSI-Lectures-2022/blob/main/1%20-%20Keras%20and%20TF/code/Easy_Network_with_Keras.ipynb)

The hands-on session will be based mostly on one [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/toelt-llc/SUPSI-Lectures-2022/blob/main/1%20-%20Keras%20and%20TF/code/Easy_Network_with_Keras.ipynb).

## Additional Material

- A nice video introduction to Google Colab can be found in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW29067qVWk&t=212s). The official website for the jupyter notebook project can be found [here](https://jupyter.org). 

- You can also find an introduction to Neural Networks in the slides for a lecture given by Umberto Michelucci at the ETH university in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland. They are google slides and should be accessible online easily.
